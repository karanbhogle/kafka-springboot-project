# SpringBoot + Apache Kafka

This is my attempt at learning Apache Kafka along with SpringBoot. This SpringBoot app let's user send message to a topic via URL Query Parameter of an HTTP Request and receives it on the console.

I have logged my entire journey of basics of Apache Kafka and ZooKeeper on my Medium article here

You can check my code here in this repository.
